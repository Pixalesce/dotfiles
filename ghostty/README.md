Hopping onto the exciting project that aims to be the best terminal emulator, built by a co-founder of [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/)! Can't go wrong right?

Thanks to his focus on building for out of the box usage with minimal configuration, you'll find that only a minimal configuration file is necessary!
