# Pix dotfiles
Over time as I have been tinkering around with various command line centric applications, the number of configuration files I have to maintain gradually increased. As such, I have decided to bring my dotfiles and configurations into a single repo to save me from maintaining multiple repos.

My workflow currently consists of [Alacritty](alacritty/README.md) + [Neovim](nvim/README.md) + [Tmux](tmux/README.md).
